I created the first simple design for my website. Tried going for a dento style with multiple windows which all have different contents. Not completely done yet , but planning on adding a Spotify - Now Playing, Discord Status (and maybe weather) display.
++ time greetings
I used AI to get a general understanding of how to position the elements on the screen but did NOT copy & paste any code.

I first added a cool animation when hovering over the boxes - the box the user is hovering over gets highlighted while the other ones are getting faded out.
Then I decided, it would be better to center all the boxes vertically. Since I had no idea, how to do that, I asked ChatGPT.
Also added some contents into the 3 boxes: my local time, the local time of the user viewing the website + started working on a weather display which displays the weather of the user viewing the website by finding the location via IP address and passing it onto freeweatherapi to find the current temperature. :)
also reduced the glowyness of the boxes..

I added all the functionality to the local weather display. The API guide for freeweatherapi didn't really work, so I found the official documentation and used that to get the current temperature of the user viewing the website by first locating them via their IP address and then passing that onto the API to get the current temperature. Didn't actually use any AI (chatgpt etc) for this one, just the docs and some automatic formatting by GitHub Copilot.

I added some socials links to my GitHub and Discord profiles and added a clickable weather display so it doesn't use up my free API calls.

I experimented a lot with a new background design and also changed some smaller stuff, like highlighting the text with a blue glow effect and adding a waving hand (hehe)

Thought a lot about how to implement the Spotify - Now Playing feature and I had no idea how to create it. Looked for the official Spotify API but it didn't really work out so I tried using last.fm's free API which also didn't work out at all, so I searched around quite a lot and finally found Lanyard, which tracks my Discord Status and also shows my Spotify (discord status). Tried implementing that, took a while but eventually worked out :) Also changed some of the colors.
Took a lot of time, didn't use any AI for this one. really proud of myself

I added some photos I took into a scrolling gallery. Used ChatGPT for the styling and scrolling animation of the gallery (CSS). Also added a small "About Me" section with some information about me and my interests. Searching out the photos took a while but I really like the result.
Planning on adding a better Clock UI and some responsive design since the page is only optimized for my PC right now.
Some small changes & bug fixes.
