I created the first simple design for my website. Tried going for a dento style with multiple windows which all have different contents. Not completely done yet , but planning on adding a Spotify - Now Playing, Discord Status (and maybe weather) display.
++ time greetings
I used AI to get a general understanding of how to position the elements on the screen but did NOT copy & paste any code.

I first added a cool animation when hovering over the boxes - the box the user is hovering over gets highlighted while the other ones are getting faded out.
Then I decided, it would be better to center all the boxes vertically. Since I had no idea, how to do that, I asked ChatGPT.
Also added some contents into the 3 boxes: my local time, the local time of the user viewing the website + started working on a weather display which displays the weather of the user viewing the website by finding the location via IP address and passing it onto freeweatherapi to find the current temperature. :)
also reduced the glowyness of the boxes..
